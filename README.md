## Inspiration
Everyday calculators that I use to learn and for help the maths homework.
I wanted to learn formulas for advance algebric functions and wanted to learn how to write a program to solve some the algebra problems.

## What it does
Solves various problems and shows steps instead of just showing the answer.

## How we built it
I used Java as a programming language and created a library of functions that can be expanded in future.

## Challenges we ran into
Formatting,  having functions that effectively call each other.  I did not know how to generalize some of the algebra functions - like solving quadratic equation but I learned as I built this program.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating something that is both functional, but useful, applicable, helpful, and something that can be easily pushed to the next level.  

## What we learned
We learnt how to effectively use System.out.printf function to create formatted output.

Learnt how to use java.util.Scanner to read various inputs - like string, numbers etc from the console.

## What's next for Math Calculator 
* Implementing new functions for higher levels of mathematics and dealing with more abstract and complex ideas. 
* My goal is to make this calculator available to everyone so people can learn maths using an interactive console and in future build a webapp that can be used by students around the world. Specially those who do not have access to home tutors.
